Second, download the [chrome driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Make sure the version matches to the version of Chrome.

Place the driver on the same directory as the program.

Finally run the program. A log-in window will pop up. Login with your account and move on to the course registration page.
The automation process will start looking for available course and register for you.
